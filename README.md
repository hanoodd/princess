# Princess Toomie & The Evil Witch Hanoodie: The Kidnapping of Prince Rock

Description: 
The project follows a story narrative with a our own take on a conventional trope, (prince saves a princess). We implemented themes of 'Good Vs Evil' by establishing early on the evil villian as well as the protagonist. They also have an intense battle which is the climax of our story. We really wanted the audience to be able to use the audio effectively to visualise what scene we were trying to play with the help of the on queue images that are shown on the website.

Process:
We reveresed the conventional trope where the princess would save the prince instead to make our specific story more unique. We then created a script for all 4 characters that we voice acted for. After, we all were given the task to edit the 4 seperate 30 second scenes using Audacity to then combine and create a seemless story that flows with the visuals shown on the website.

Reflection/Evaluation:
Our expectations and goals were all met in this project to make an engaging sound story by combining helpful visuals. By giving feedback to eachother, we were able to enhance each of our tasked Audacity scene edits to meet this goal and increase the quality of our story. The only challenging part of this assignment was being able to code the images to switch at specific time intervals of the audio which took 2 days to figure out properly.
